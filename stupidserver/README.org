* ABOUT

This is a simple server made in C++ using the default winsock library that comes with Windows
This is my first project of C++ and to be fair, my first programming project itself 
I think this project really helped me getting started with programming and 
I feel motivated to do other projects as well
But for now, only a server


* BUILD

Since this only has like 3 files I didn't bother adding a build system 
But this is how to build this project 

#+begin_src shell
  cl.exe /c Main.cpp Server.cpp
  link Main.obj Server.obj /OUT:Server.exe
#+end_src
